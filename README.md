**Japanese Kanji Graph**

The nodes represent Japanese kanji and the edges represent words that can be comprised. Bigger nodes mean higher degree. The resulting clusters are thought to represent semantic fields of Japanese kanji words.
Rescaling the nodes according to betweenness centrality does not really change the graph. Thus, bigger nodes could also be interpreted as central.

The data for this graph was compiled from the list of 44998 most frequent Japanese words https://github.com/hingston/japanese
All words containg kana or one-kanji words were eliminated. The number of words represented in this graph is 18848, with 16343 of them consisting of two kanji.

Important. The files must be uploaded to a webserver (or run one locally) in order to be viewed. JavaScript security prevents running the pages locally without a webserver.

The InteractiveVis project of the Oxford Internet Institute with funding by JISC aims to allow easy creation of interactive visualisations for geospatial and network data using native web technologies (HTML5, CSS3, and SVG) and allow these visualisations to be self-contained so that they may run entirely offline in ebooks and other media. The project will survey existing solutions and build the necessary components to fill in missing features and smooth over incompatibilities in between existing libraries. The project will further provide online hosted wizards to allow for the easy creation of these interactive visualizations.
